Now suppose that we want to limit the choices and we only want to compare two specific models and decide which one is \"more probable\". The two models can follow the same family of distributions but with two sets of parameters, for example, normal with two different means, or we can compare the normal distribution to logistic with fixed parameters. Based on these two options, we can design two hypotheses: \n",
