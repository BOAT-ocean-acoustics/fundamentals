# Computing Environment

The tutorials in this book can be executed directly in a Python ennvironment. For that you can use a service provided by GitHub called [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). It includes free usage tier for running the code (from a GitHub repository or new code) through a [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor interface. 

```{note}

* 1 hour on a 2-core (default) machine == 1 core hour
* Students can get a GitHub PRO account.

5. To return to a codespace navigate to [https://github.com/<your_username>/codespaces/]() or open the settings on the top-left triple bar and select Codespaces.

6. A codespace is deleted if inactive for 30 days. A also restarts periodically. Regularly save your work. If you use GitHub you can commit it to your repository (either through the GitHub integration or through commands on the terminal).
 
7. When you have finished using the codespace, make sure you stop it so you do not waste core hours. Your work will be preserved.

```{caution} 
If you have already used your Codespaces allocation for personal needs, you can clone the repository and execute the notebooks on your computer. Let us know if you encounter any setup problems.
