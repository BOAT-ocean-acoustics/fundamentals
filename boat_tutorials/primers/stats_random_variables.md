## Ocean Sound Levels Experiment

Suppose we want to study the ocean sound levels and would like to know if it is "louder" during a given period of time compared to an earlier time. For example, we may have different hypotheses:
* The ocean within the Puget Sound (a high ship traffic zone in the Pacific Northwest) is "louder" on a summer day, than on a winter day.
* The ocean is "louder" in more recent years than in previous years due to overall increase of ship traffic.
* The ocean is "louder" during a storm than on a calm day.
* The ocean is "louder" (at certain frequencies) when there are many orcas present. 

To answer the first question we can design an experiment to collect observations and test our hypothesis. We can plan to setup a hydrophone at a specific location, or identify existinging hydrophone datasets collected in the region. We want to know the sound level at a given place at a given time, however, before we measure it we do not know what exactly the outcome will be. We are performing a **random experiment**.  However, we know what the potential outcomes can be, i.e. the **sample space** of the experiment. In the case of the hydrophone, the sample space includes all dB values that the hydrophone can record (the range of the transmitted sounds can be different). This is an example of a **continuous random variable**. We can also observe **discrete random variables**, which can take a value from a (countable) set of a discrete values. For example, we can transform the hydrophone recording into a binary variable which indicates presence or absence of a marine mammal call within a time window. In Sec ??, we will review more example of random variable with some examples from ocean acoustics.

*Exercise:* Outline a random experiment within your research area, identify the random variables observed, and their sample space.
