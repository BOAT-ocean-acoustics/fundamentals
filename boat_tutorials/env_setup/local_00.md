# Local environment setup

In this section, we will walk you through the steps needed to set up a local computation envrionment, which you can use to run all the tutorials (i.e. the widgets will be "alive" and responding to changing inputs).

The steps are:
- [Install Git](local_setup_git)
- [Install conda/mamba](local_setup_conda)
- [Create a conda environment](local_setup_create_env)

```{Note}
:class: note
If you have access to a JupyterHub (which usually already have git and conda installed), you can follow the steps in [Create an conda environment](local_setup_create_env) to create an environment on the JupyterHub to run the tutorials.
```

Many of the instructions here were inspired from [these setup instructions from TU Dresden](https://biapol.github.io/blog/mara_lampert/getting_started_with_miniforge_and_python/readme.html) for biological image analysis.
