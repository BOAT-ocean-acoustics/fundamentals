# Conceptual framework


## Learning goals

1. Identify the components of the system you are studying
2. Identify known relationships and known processes
3. Understand what is possible and caveats given the system


## Overview: motivating examples
Description of scenarios without using the sonar equation first

To get a better handle on what we plan to learn together, let's first take a look at the follow motivating examples.

### How do we study the life of an Orca?
Orcas, or killer whales (_Orcinus orca_), are toothed whales that use sounds to communicate with each other and find food in the ocean.

- Listening for killer whales using hydrophones to know where and who (which "pod") has shown up
- "Resident" killer whales
    - typically hang out in coastal waters primarily eat fish, such as salmon.
    - They use their biological sonar system - echolocation - to detect, track, and then catch fish.
    - Explain echolocation
- "Transient" killer whales
    - primarily eat pinnipeds, like seals
    - seals can hear pretty well, so the killer whales listen for vocalization made by seals to find them, before homing in using echolocation
- other examples
    - blue whales communicate across ocean basin
    - humpback whales cultural transmission of call units


### How are these related to our daily lives?
- Human senses
    - humans rely predominantly on vision to navigate the world
    - however listening is an important sensory modality for us and often bring powerful experiences
    - nevertheless, some unsighted humans have developed the ability to echolocate, just like the killer whales
- Technology that uses similar principles
    - radar
        - uses backscatter (EM energy bounced off from objects) to sense the environment
        - weather patterns (clouds, rain, snow, etc)
        - bird migration
    - medical ultrasound
        - non-invasive imaging of the interior of human body



## The mighty Sonar Equation

- Sonar equation: RL = SL + 2 TL + TS
- what are these terms? (conceptual descriptions of each term)
    - RL: receive level
    - SL: source level
    - TL: transmission loss
        - sound travel takes time, the medium matters (air vs water)
    - TS: target strength
- Diagram for the connection between all the components
- Two examples (with pictures!) consisting of the terms (some are known, some are unknown)
    1. killer whale hunting for fish
        - goal of analysis: are these fish salmon or herring?
        - assumptions: no multipath
    2. humans use hydrophones to listen for killer whales
        - goal of analysis: how far are the whales?
        - assumptions: constant sound speed profile/absorption
- Goal of analysis
    - are these fish salmon or herring?



## What are decibels, and why do we use them?
- General discussion of decibels
- How sound “looks” like – find some nice websites (google famous sounds?)




## How are these related to your own research?

### Exercise
1. How do we use echosounder to probe the environment?
    - what are the components in the sonar equation this maps to?
    - identify at least one possible research question can be answered from echosounder experiment and at least
    - identify at least one caveat associated with the approach
2. Mapping your research project onto the sonar equation
    - discuss which component your work falls into
    - what are the caveats?
