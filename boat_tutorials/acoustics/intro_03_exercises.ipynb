    "Here, all the numbers are represented in **decibels**, or \"**dB**,\" which is a unitless, logarithmic measure widely used in ocean acoustics. We use the this measure in order to easily compare sound as loud as a jet taking off right outside of your window (~140 dB re 20 $\\mu$Pa) with sound as soft as dropping a needle on the floor (~15 dB re 20 $\\mu$Pa). Go to the [](primer-decibel) page to learn about this useful measure.\n",

    "**Try this for yourself:** By keeping $\\textrm{TL}$ the same, you can see how much harder it is to hear fish echoes compared to Ola's sound, just because the sound needs to travel twice of the distance! Note that $\\textrm{TL}$ is also typically a negative number when measured in decibel, which we will explain in [](acoustics-target_strength).\n",

    "Echosounder are high-frequency sonar systems widely used to \"image\" the interior of the ocean. It operates by transmitting signals (\"pings\") and receiving echo returns from any objects or boundaries underwater. Below is a sketch of how an echosounder measurement scenario looks like:\n",
