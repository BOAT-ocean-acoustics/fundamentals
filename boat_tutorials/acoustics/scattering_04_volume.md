## Volume scattering
- what can we infer using these models?
    - seabed composition
    - fish density in an aggregation
- connect back to discrete scatterers
    - mention multiple scattering and connect to transmission coefficients ([connect to TL page]())
- **widget**: seabed volume scattering strength
    - allow changing material properties, porosity, frequency range
- others:
    - turbulence ([deeper topic]())
    - micro structures ([deeper topic]())
