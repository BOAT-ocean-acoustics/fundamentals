## Surface scattering
- what can we infer using these models?
    - seabed composition
    - surface roughness
- plane wave assumption
    - this is a revisit/quick mention ([connect to TL page]())
    - show angular and frequency dependency ([connect to spectrum/fourier analysis]())
- definition: scattering strength per unit area
- the same concept applies to sea surface scattering
- **widget**: seafloor scattering strength
    - allow changing roughness and grazing angle, frequency range
- examples:
    - perfect place to talk about sidescan: find object from noisy seafloor
