## Introduction

From our everyday experience, we encounter many sources of sound in our environment: A knuckle rapping on a door, the wind blowing through the leaves of tree, a group of people having a conversation... While these sound sources are all very different from one another, they each have common properties that we can use to describe and compare them. These include the amplitude of the sound being produced, the changes in the sound over time, and the directions in which the sound is being projected. In the following notebook, we will look closely at these descriptors of sound and the sources that produce it, with a particular focus on sonar systems.

Before diving in, it's worth talking about what we mean when we say "sonar systems." The term "sonar" was originally coined as an acronym for Sound Navigation and Ranging and usually refers to a sound producing and/or receiving system that operates underwater. The basic idea behind a sonar is that it takes an electronic signal, typically a voltage that varies in time, and feeds that signal into a transducer which transforms that voltage into mechanical motion that generates sound. Any device that converts energy from one form to another is called a transducer. For example, the speaker in your headphones uses an electrical current to move a magnet which vibrates a surface against the air to produce sound. There are many types of transducers used in the design of sonars and the choice of transducer is often determined by the characteristics of the sound that needs to be produced. For example, an echosounder might use a small disk of piezoelectric material to produce a high-frequency, narrow beam of sound while scientists trying to transmit low-frequency sound across the Pacific Ocean used a [NEED DETAILS].

In this section we will begin by talking about the concept of the beam pattern and use the example of a baffled, circular piston to explore those aspects of the beam pattern that are common to all acoustic sources.
