Therefore, usually the receiving sensitivty is expressed in values and units like **-180 dB re 1V/µPa**, which means that this hydrophone will produce a voltage of -180 dB re 1V, or $10^{-9}$ V (see [what decibel (dB) means here](primer-decibel)) in response to a sound pressure of 1 micropascal (µPa). The negative value here just means that the conversion factor is a small number. The receiving sensitivity is what we are after when trying to _calibrate_ a hydrophone."
