## Discrete scatterers
- what can we infer using these models?
    - fish/zooplankton abundance
    - density of suspended sediment ([deeper topic]())
    - ([connect to inference/estimation page]())
- point scatterer
- spheres of different material properties
    - show TS spectra of rigid, bubble, fluid, elastic ([deeper topic]()), this brings in frequency dependency ([connect to spectrum]())
    - solve rigid sphere and bubble? -- would that be too much materials?
    - **widget**: 1D bubble spectra
        - allow changing material properties (except for elastic), size, frequency range
    - talk about frequency dependency using the bubble example
- non-spherical scatterers
    - show TS spectra for fluid prolate spheroid, this brings in orientation dependency ([connect to SL/beampattern]())
    - **widget**: fluid prolate spheroid spectra over all angles
        - allow changing aspect ratio, size, frequency range
- practical examples:
    - fish school: assume no bio attenuation, no multiple scattering, no shadowing
    - echogram with fish vs zooplankton
    - acoustic color for info content in TS
    - sidescan (tie to propagation/TL section)
    - SAS
