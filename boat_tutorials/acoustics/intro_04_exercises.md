## Apply the SONAR equation to other ocean acoustics problems

Having seen how the SONAR equation can be applied to study the orcas, let's try to apply the same principle to analyze another couple ocean acoustics problems.

### Exercise 1: "Looking" under the sea surface using an echosounder
Echosounder are high-frequency sonar systems widely used to "image" the interior of the ocean. It operates by transmitting signals ("pings") and receiving echo returns from any objects or boundaries underwater. Below is a sketch of how an echosounder measurement scenario looks like:

Try to see if you can figure out the following:
- Identify the various terms in the SONAR equations in this sketch
- Identify at least one scientific question or application that can benefit from using an echosounder

### Exercise 2: Apply to your own research
If you have done or are thinking about doing research on an ocean acoustics-related topic, what is it? Think of one question you may want to answer or an application you may want to try, and try to see if you can figure out the following:
- Put together a quick sketch of the "system" of your ocean acoustics problem
- Identify the various terms in the SONAR equations in this sketch
- Identify at least one component in the sketch or one term in the SONAR equation that you would like to learn more about from the tutorials
