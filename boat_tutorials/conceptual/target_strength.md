# Target strength


## Introduction
- intuitively, what is target strength (TS)? 
    - how much sound energy bounces off (scatters) from a target? 
absorption
    - more generally: scattering strength?
- when/how is it used?
    - characterize scatterers or scattering sources independent of the complications of the transmit signals ([connec to SL]()) and the propagation environment ([connect to TL]())


## Setup and terminology
- monostatic vs bistatic ([deeper topic]())
- differential scattering cross section --> TS ([connect to decibel page]())
- total scattering cross section
- extinction cross section (total power removed from the incident sound):
    - scattering cross section + absorption cross section

## Discrete scatterers
- what can we infer using these models?
    - fish/zooplankton abundance
    - density of suspended sediment ([deeper topic]())
- point scatterer
- spherical cows
    - rigid sphere
    - bubble
    - elastic sphere ([deeper topic]())
- non-spherical cows
    - bring in orientation ([connect to SL/beampattern]()) and frequency dependency ([connect to spectrum]())
    - types:
        - air inclusion (fish swimbladder)
        - soft body (squid, krill)
        - elastic structure (pteropod)
- practical example:
    - fish school: assume no bio attenuation, no multiple scattering, no shadowing
    - echogram with fish vs zooplankton


## Surface scattering
- what can we infer using these models?
    - seabed composition
    - surface roughness
- rigid surface vs rough interface
    - angular and frequency dependency ([connect to spectrum/fourier analysis]())


## Volume scattering
- what can we infer using these models?
    - seabed composition
- below seafloor volumetric scattering
    - 
- others:
    - turbulence ([deeper topic]())
    - micro structures ([deeper topic]())
