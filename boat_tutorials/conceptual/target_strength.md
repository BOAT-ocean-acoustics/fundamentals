# Target strength


## Introduction
- intuitively, what is target strength (TS)? 
    - how much sound energy bounces off (scatters) from a target? 
absorption
    - more generally: scattering strength?
- when/how is it used?
    - characterize scatterers or scattering sources independent of the complications of the transmit signals ([connec to SL]()) and the propagation environment ([connect to TL]())


## Setup and terminology
- monostatic vs bistatic ([deeper topic]())
- extinction cross section (total power removed from the incident sound):
    - total scattering cross section + total absorption cross section
- total scattering cross section
  - add intuitive example: shooting pellets to a sphere, what bounces away is related to the concept of "cross section"
  - explain carefully that this is a conceptual example and that is not all it is
- differential scattering cross section --> TS ([connect to decibel page]())


## Discrete scatterers
- what can we infer using these models?
    - fish/zooplankton abundance
    - density of suspended sediment ([deeper topic]())
    - ([connect to inference/estimation page]())
- point scatterer
- spheres of different material properties
    - show TS spectra of rigid, bubble, fluid, elastic ([deeper topic]()), this brings in frequency dependency ([connect to spectrum]())
    - solve rigid sphere and bubble? -- would that be too much materials?
    - talk about frequency dependency using the bubble example
- non-spherical scatterers
    - show TS spectra for krill, this brings in orientation dependency ([connect to SL/beampattern]())
- practical examples:
    - fish school: assume no bio attenuation, no multiple scattering, no shadowing
    - echogram with fish vs zooplankton
    - acoustic color for info content in TS
    - sidescan (tie to propagation/TL section)
    - SAS


## Surface scattering
- what can we infer using these models?
    - seabed composition
    - surface roughness
- plane wave assumption
    - this is a revisit/quick mention ([connect to TL page]())
    - show angular and frequency dependency ([connect to spectrum/fourier analysis]())
- definition: scattering strength per unit area
- the same concept applies to sea surface scattering
- examples:
    - perfect place to talk about sidescan: find object from noisy seafloor


## Volume scattering
- what can we infer using these models?
    - seabed composition
    - fish density in an aggregation
- connect back to discrete scatterers
    - mention multiple scattering and connect to transmission coefficients ([connect to TL page]())
- others:
    - turbulence ([deeper topic]())
    - micro structures ([deeper topic]())
