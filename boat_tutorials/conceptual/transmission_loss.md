# Transmission loss

## Free space propagation
- Point source
	- Spherical spreading
		- Illustration
- Multiple sources
	- Interference
	- Simple widget
		- Two sources, change frequency (of each?), location, plot field either pressure or intensity

## Impacts of the medium
- Sound speed
	- Travel time
	- Refraction
		- Basic idea
		- Example - illustration
- Attenuation
	- Attenuation curve for seawater - Figure
	
## Reflection and transmission
- Basic idea
	- Reflection 
	- Snell's law
- Widget to generate reflection coefficient versus angle
	1. Ability to change parameters: sound speed, density, attenuation
		- Units for attenuation is a question
	2. Topics to address:
		- Critical angle
		- intromission angle
			- Subnotebook with greater detail
- Sea surface reflection??
- Elastic Media???

## Ocean propagation
- Multipath and bottom loss
	- Example
		- Narrowband
		- Wideband
		- Simple widget with Rays and timeseries?
		- Change bottom type???
- Sound speed profile
	- Precomputed examples
		- See Brekovskih for examples
- Bathymetry
	- Wedge?
	- Sea mount?
