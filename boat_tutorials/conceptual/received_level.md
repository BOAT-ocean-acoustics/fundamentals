# Received level


## Introduction
- received level (RL) combines all effects in the round trip from transmission, propagation, and scattering
    - connect back to sonar equation


## Example uses
- detect target presence
- distinguish target types
- understanding propagation environment
    - discuss the "time" that does not appear in the sonar equation
