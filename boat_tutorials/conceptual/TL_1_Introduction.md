# Introduction

Unlike the vacuum of space or the air of our atmosphere, light does not travel very far in the underwater environment. It is strongly absorbed by the water molecules themselves and scattered by suspended particles and material in the water column. In a crystal clear lake, you might be able to see out 200 feet (60 m) but usually it is much less. Sound, on the other hand, can travel much, much further. Sound is a traveling wave of compression and rarefaction of the water itself. While the water molecules will also absorb some of it's energy, this absorption is weak as compared to light and in fact, low frequency sound in the ocean can travel half way around the world. It could go further if not for the continents that tend to get in the way. 

In this section, we will explore some the concepts behind sound propagation and explore those aspects of the underwater environment that affect the ability of sound to travel long distances. While we will begin by revisiting the concept of simple sound sources and how the sound generated by these sources interact with one another, the majority of this section will explore how the underwater environment affects the propagation of sound. The key aspects of the environment which affect propagation include the sea surface, the seafloor, and even the properties of the water itself. We will conclude this section by considering how the combined effects of the environment can either enhance or diminish the ability of sound to travel long distances in the ocean.
