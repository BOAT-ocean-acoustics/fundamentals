# What is BOAT?

Bridge to Ocean Acoustic and Technology (BOAT) is a program that aims to broaden the participation of ocean acoustics research by creating open, executable, and web-hosted tutorials that encapsulate fundamental ocean acoustics knowledge and techniques as living documents.

In the current "pilot" stage, we will focus on two ocean acoustics subfields, the scattering of seabed and the scattering of marine organisms in the water column, to establish a set of "blueprints" that may be helpful for other researcher to develop similar modules focused on other OA subfields for the future expansion of BOAT toward a broad-based, community-driven program.


## Tutorial structure
BOAT tutorials are structured with three sets of inter-linked materials:

### Conceptual framework
Tutorials aimed at building up a conceptual level of understanding that allow students to think about ocean acoustics problems in a holistic manner

### In-depth knowledge
Tutorials aimed at digging into technical details of solving ocean acoustics problems and building in-depth understanding of specific topics.

### Technical primers
Primer notebooks introducing specific technical topics that are used in ocean acoustics problems ubiquitously.
