## Introduction to Random Variables, Distributions, and Sampling
`distributions.ipynb`

Learning Objectives:

* What is a random variable?

* Review of some popular distributions with summary of their properties and an example use case from ocean acoustics
  * Normal distribution
  * Poisson distribution
  * Exponentinal distribution 
  * Log-normal distribution
  * Raleigh distribution
  * Gaussian Mixture


* Empirical Distributions
  * histogram
  * empirical cumulative distribution?

* Exercise: 
  * load some data
  * generate histogram
  * estimate the probability that X>x
  * visually inspect what popular distribution we could use to model the data
  * widget to select the parameters of a distribution to fit the data (plot of density function over data histogram)
  * reference to future chapter on maximum likelihood


## Confidence Intervals
confidence_intervals.ipynb

Learning Objectives:

* statement
* visual demonstration
* widget to see performance as we change parameters
* bootstrap confidence Intervals
* widget to demonstrate performance as we change parameters


## Limit Theorems
`limit_theorems.ipynb`

Learning Objectives:

* Law of Large Numbers
  * statement
  * example when it holds: exponential distribution
  * example when it does not hold: Cauchy distribution

* Central Limit Theorem
  * statement
  * example when it holds: exponential distribution
  * example when it does not hold: Cauchy distribution


## Testing
* Statistical Hypothesis
* Statistical Test, P-value

# Signal Processing

## Spectral Analysis
* Fourier Transform
* Power Spectral Density
* Spectrogram
    * Widget changing window size and frequency
    * Discussing different frequency bands
