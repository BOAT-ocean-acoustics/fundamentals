    "## Circular, piston transducer\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common man-made sound sources used in underwater acoustics are planer transducers which have flat surfaces which oscillate to produce sound. This is in part due to the fact that a flat transducer is relatively easy to manufacturer, but more importantly, the transducer transmits a majority of the sound in the direction perpendicular to the vibrating plane.  This is a useful property in many sonar systems and this directivity of the transmitted sound can help determine the location of an object (fish, bubble, submarine, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we said the transducer directs a \"majority\" of the sound in one direction and not \"all\" of the sound. In fact, the transducer sends different levels of sound in many directions and the directional dependence of the sound is refered to as the transducer's **beam pattern**. To help understand the concept of a beam pattern and it's properties, we will focus initially on one particular, common type of tranducer: the circular piston. This type of transducer is often a cylindrical piece of piezoelectric material to which an electrical signal is applied such that it expands and contracts along the axis of the cylinder. The causes sound to radiate from the circular face of the transducer. The structure of the sound field from this type of transducer can be fairly complicated and there is not a simple, mathematical expression for the direction and strength of the transmitted sound. There are, however, approximate mathematical descriptions that can be accurately describe the transmitted sound under certain conditions. One of the most useful of these is to assume that the transducer an be approximated as a baffled circular piston. By \"baffled,\" we mean that the face of the transducer is surrounded by an infinite, rigid surface. This simplifies the mathematics and allows us to calculate strength and direction of the transmitted field.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, the face of the transducer will be in the x-y plane and the z-axis is perpendicular to the face. The radius of the tranducer is ***a*** and the field will be described in two ways; either a function of the distance, ***r***, from the center of the face and the angle, ***$\\theta$***, between the direction of ***r*** and the -axis or as a function of distance from the plane of the transducer (range) and the perpendicular direction (cross-range.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Piston](images/quick_piston.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " If the sound is measured far away from the face of the transducer, the intensity of the sound will be proportional to $1/r^2$ and the angular-dependence of the field can be expressed in a simple form that does not depend on the distance. When the reciever is sufficiently far away that these two properties are true, then the receiver is said to be in the **far-field** of the transducer. In the widget below, we've removed the $1/r^2$ dependence and normalized the intensity by the value measured on the z-axis or $\\theta = 0^\\circ$. As a result, the normalized intensity is 0 dB (or 1 on a linear scale.) The widget allows you to make the transducer larger or smaller by increasing it's radius and allows you to change the frequency of the sound being transmitted. You can also display the angular dependence of the transmitted sound on different plots and on both a linear and decibel scale."

    "One of the things you'll notice as you decrease the frequency or decrease the radius, is that the central part of the beam pattern gets wider. This central portion of the beam pattern that includes the maximum at 0 degrees and is enclosed by the first null (points where the level gets very low) is called the **main lobe** or **main beam**. Most of the energy of the transmitted sound lies in this beam. As a result, most applications try to utilize just this beam. A key parameter for the transducer is width of this main beam or the **beam width**. The beam width is defined as the width of the beam when the field drops to a set level below the maximum value. This level is sometimes defined as 3 dB, 6 dB, or 10 dB which on a linear scale corresponds to 1/2, 1/4, or 1/10 of the maximum of the maximum value of the main lobe. For example, [SS510 echosounder spec sheet](https://www.teledynemarine.com/en-us/products/SiteAssets/Odom/transducers/SMBB200-9.pdf) states that when operating at 200 kHz, the beam width is 9 degrees @ -3 dB. The table above shows the beamwidth defined relate to the different levels for the plotted beam pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other beams or lobes are often referred to as **side lobes**. Notice that while the shape of the main lobe and the side lobes change significantly with frequency and transducer radius, the maximum level of the two sidelobes on either side of the main lobe is always at the same level, 17 dB, or 1/50 of the main lobe. This doesn't always hold true for all piston transducers but is a good approximation for the level of the first side lobe and is a useful rule of thumb for the far-field of the transducer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The field of the piston transducer is calculated below as a function of range from the transducer face and cross-range. While the calculation above shows how the field behaves as a function of angle relative to piston's center, this calculation shows how the field varies throughout the water in front of the sound source."

    "One important property of the far-field of a transducer is that the sound in this region all appears to coming from a single point on the transducer. This is what leads to the  $1/r^2$ decrease in the intensity with range. Near the face of the transducer, this is no longer true and there is a region where the sound from one part of the transducer is interfering with sound from other parts of the transducer and there are no clear beams. This region is refered to as the **near-field** of the transducer. There is no simple mathematical expression for the sound field in this region, but we can numerically determine the full field for the baffled piston and the result for $f = 12 kHz$ and $a = 0.5 m$ is shown in the plot on the right below. The plot on the left shows the far-field approximation using the same set of paramters. In this plot, regardless of how close you get to the transducer face, the field will always appear to come from a point at the center of the transducer. In the full-field calculation, this is no longer true. There is sound coming from the entire face of the transducer, which spans -0.5 m to 0.5 m, and there is a complicated interference pattern out to about 2 m in range. Beyond this point, the fields start to become similar."

Notice that as you go further out in range, the two curves begin to converge which indicates when the transition from the near-field to the far-field has occured. There are a number of ways to estimate when this transition between near-field and far-field occurs. One useful estimate is that the range from the transducer needs to satisfy $r \\gg 2a$ and $r \\gg \\pi a^2/\\lambda$. In these calculations, the speed of sound is $c = 1500$ m/s and using the relationship between frequency and wavelength, $c = f\\lambda$ , you can varify that this conditions hold as you change the frequency and radius of the transducer.

To determine the source level, the pressure in the far-field is extrapolated back to a range of 1 m from the transducer. The mean square of the pressure, $p_{RMS}^2$, where $p_{RMS}$ is the root mean square of the pressure, is then taken and referenced to an pressure of $p_{ref} = 1 \\mu\\text{PA}$. In decibels, the source level is expressed as \n",

    "Another common transducer design is a transducer with a rectangular face. For the circular piston, we saw that as we increased the diameter of the piston face, the main beam became narrower in all directions. For the rectangular piston, as one of the axes of the rectangle is lengthened, the beam in the plane parallel to that axis will also become narrower while the beam perpendicular to that axis remains largely unchanged. This can be really useful in situations where you want a narrow beam in one direction and a wide beam in the other direction. Side scan sonars use a rectangular transducer to make it possible to image using a beam projected from the side of towed sonar that is wide in the vertical direction but very narrow in the direction of the towed.
