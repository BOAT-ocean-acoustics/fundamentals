# Bridge to Ocean Acoustics and Technology (BOAT)

This repository hosts the initial development of the tutorials for the Bridge to Ocean Acoustics and Technology (BOAT) program.

We may break up this repository into multiple repositories as the materials grow and we invite others to join the effort.

Below is a quick summary of what are in the folder:
- [conceptual](./boat_tutorials/conceptual/): pages in the first (conceptual) level
- [in_depth](./boat_tutorials/in_depth/): pages in the deeper level
- [others](./boat_tutorials/others): concepts and technical materials used in main tutorial pages
- [images](./boat_tutorials/images): images used in the tutorial pages
- [matlab](./boat_tutorials/matlab): matlab LiveScripts that prototype Python interactive widget implementations
- [templates](./boat_tutorials/templates): templates from the JupyterBook starting pages for reference
