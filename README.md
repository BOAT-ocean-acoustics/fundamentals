# BOAT fundamentals

This repository hosts the _fundamentals_ tutorials for the [Bridge to Ocean Acoustics and Technology (BOAT)](https://boat-ocean-acoustics.github.io/) program. 

Here, you will find tutorials that **introduce fundamental ocean acoustics concepts via plain languages and interactive "widgets"** that you can play with to develop physical intuition and think about ocean acoustic problems in a holistic manner.

The tutorials are in the format of an executable Jupyter Book, and you can:
- browse directly the [pre-built version](https://boat-fundamentals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/landing.html), or
- open up the GitHub codespaces to try out the widgets interactively (see [instructions here](https://boat-fundamentals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/primers/codespaces.html) to get set up)
